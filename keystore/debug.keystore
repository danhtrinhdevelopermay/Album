This is a placeholder for the debug keystore file.

In a real Android project, this would be a binary keystore file created with keytool.

For development purposes, you can create one using:
keytool -genkey -v -keystore debug.keystore -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias androiddebugkey

Use the following details for debug keystore:
- Password: android
- Key alias: androiddebugkey  
- Key password: android
- All other fields can be left as "Unknown" or with default values

NEVER use this keystore for production releases!
